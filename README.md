Please see the documentation.pdf for additional information. Also see the [project page](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/research/scene-understanding/pose-estimation/#DSAC). You can download pre-trained models for 7Scenes [here](https://cloudstore.zih.tu-dresden.de/index.php/s/zvPvVD1b0M7EoVd/download)

**Note:** Beginning of August 2017, we updated the public version of the code to contain a fix in the pose evaluation metric, and to utilize a more stable variant of the PnP algorithm. These changes result in improved numbers compared to the original version of the paper. The improved numbers and a more detailed explanation can be found in the current version of the paper on arXiv. The current version of the code contains both fixes, and also the pre-trained models have been updated, accordingly.
